(#1564)\n- Fix test failure: /bin/sleep on Macos 11 (Monterey) does not accept the suffix s. (#1472)\n\n\n## Misc\n\n- Update dependency check for dotnet 6. (#1551)\n- Produce trimmed down runner packages. (#1556)\n- Deleted extra background in github-praph.png, which is displayed in README.md (#1432)\n\n\n## Windows x64\nWe recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. \"C:\\actions-runner\"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.286.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.286.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.286.0.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;\n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.286.0.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.286.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.286.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.286.0/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.286.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.286.0/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.286.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.286.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product

This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;\n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product docs.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)\n\n## SHA-256 Checksums\n\nThe SHA-256 checksums for the packages included in this build are shown below:\n\n- actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip <!-- BEGIN SHA win-x64 -->7785341894d93b040aaef6656786f44b8fc52d8042f267705bf287939ce58f71<!-- END SHA win-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA osx-x64 -->5f9dc650058151ddec7308d1fde89ab926af9dfcb5cf8137e6fe520baee8dbd3<!-- END SHA osx-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-x64 -->1ddfd7bbd3f2b8f5684a7d88d6ecb6de3cb2281a2a359543a018cc6e177067fc<!-- END SHA linux-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm64 -->a7a4e31d93d5852710dbacbb5f024be581c337c1be92ba2c729bb81e756bd49b<!-- END SHA linux-arm64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm -->2891eefcd2cd0cea33aef2261b628017d0879f69d66481c18350e2e50f3933f3<!-- END SHA linux-arm -->",

This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.283.2/actions-runner-win-x64-2.283.2.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.283.2.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;\n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.283.2.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.283.2/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.283.2/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.283.2/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.283.2.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.283.2/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.283.2.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.283.2.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product docs.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)\n\n## SHA-256 Checksums\n\nThe SHA-256 checksums for the packages included in this build are shown below:\n\n- actions-runner-win-x64-2.283.2.zip <!-- BEGIN SHA win-x64 -->ad249c02785a2efc9e44ee4b57e31310dd4552ef0a700a2e38fcdff00d9d53b4<!-- END SHA win-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-osx-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA osx-x64 -->d7d026b9bf1cb3f133cf53e79c71c0458a82b3f2bdb0a8859cd386ae18ee7c4a<!-- END SHA osx-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-x64-2.283.2.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-x64 -->ef2b350068f7d581eb6840e3c399a42f9cb808f7ee9a0456f3ad97c84ccb2a9d<!-- END SHA linux-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.283.2.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm64 -->990646bdced99679e752c1af9d26fdd8a93d319ce0e24c9a30c1c6b25e505ced<!-- END SHA linux-arm64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm-2.283.2.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm -->0c0c67e8a1dddccf74303d58c59477f2d233aa3f2b62e076e7f257f854ae1198<!-- END SHA linux-arm -->"

    "body": "## Features\n\n- Support the `--ephemeral` flag (#660)\n  - This optional flag will configure the runner to only take one job, and let the service un-configure the runner after that job finishes.\n  - Expect to see more info in the Github API documentation soon. We'll link to those docs directly as they become generally available!\n\n## Bugs\n\n- Fix a bug in `script/delete` wherein a repo with multiple runners would be unable to find the correct runner (#1268) (#1269)\n- Mitigate a race condition when requesting an OIDC `Id_token` (#1320)\n- Make client retries more resilient in JobServer (#1316)\n\n## Misc\n\n- Increase readability of colored console output (#1295) (#1319)\n- Add more network troubleshooting to the docs (#1325)\n- Bump [path-parse](https://github.com/jbgutierrez/path-parse) from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 (#1256)\n\n## Windows x64\nWe recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. \"C:\\actions-runner\"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.282.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.282.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.282.0.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; \n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.282.0.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.282.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.282.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.282.0/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.282.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.282.0/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.282.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.282.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product docs.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)\n\n## SHA-256 Checksums\n\nThe SHA-256 checksums for the packages included in this build are shown below:\n\n- actions-runner-win-x64-2.282.0.zip <!-- BEGIN SHA win-x64 -->947670e6999ef8aba6c4e6e728cce3bcf8be7ec8176122d22d07607b1dcabbb3<!-- END SHA win-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-osx-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA osx-x64 -->0f9397794838202426c47f619ae6fb8609041ca141ae1df10836a07c371a9baf<!-- END SHA osx-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-x64-2.282.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-x64 -->22ca06edeb02b13bf16bce4d65cc479c3bfde49a4e8a8e927ab650ffa789680c<!-- END SHA linux-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.282.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm64 -->13688fdc7b4102d48cdb9f256c69b3561e2e198277bfcc026cfadbf09e6c3960<!-- END SHA linux-arm64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm-2.282.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm -->d919535fd4869cf5994c155febd29e37cb3b6a3b1ad988f289bcb1aca37a3610<!-- END SHA linux-arm -->",

This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.280.3/actions-runner-win-x64-2.280.3.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.280.3.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; \n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.280.3.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.280.3/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.280.3/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.280.3/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.280.3.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.280.3/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.280.3.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.280.3.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product docs.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)\n\n## SHA-256 Checksums\n\nThe SHA-256 checksums for the packages included in this build are shown below:\n\n- actions-runner-win-x64-2.280.3.zip <!-- BEGIN SHA win-x64 -->d45e44d3266539c92293de235b6eea3cb2dc21fe3e5b98fbf3cfa97d38bdad9f<!-- END SHA win-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-osx-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA osx-x64 -->16683d7f180fe2255acb8b5f74142143f8ae9c894f61c51bf0c868199916e8fd<!-- END SHA osx-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-x64-2.280.3.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-x64 -->69dc323312e3c5547ba1e1cc46c127e2ca8ee7d7037e17ee6965ef6dac3c142b<!-- END SHA linux-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.280.3.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm64 -->6b838e76a3ee3ead883e1b9b395e2044af473ccf78ed3ae86e94c8801a1b620b<!-- END SHA linux-arm64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm-2.280.3.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm -->025cc11af4974ce80f7f1c2af2c55a44c055c0c983d41361e37549e05a662889<!-- END SHA linux-arm -->"
